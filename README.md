# HospitalDatabaseSQLJava

## Project Description and Context

An application designed to manage aspects of day-to-day operations in a hypothetical hospital using a relational-database
model implemented in Java and SQL with the use of Oracle.

Application written in Java that simulates day-to-day operations in a hypothetical hospital so it allows users to login 
in within their perspective view as patient, staff or receptionist. This project was created for the Computer Science course,
Introduction to Relational Databases (CPSC 304) at the University of British Columbia.

In a group we all decided to build a database for a hospital while we developed the ER diagram of the structure of the
database together. Then, I built the basic structure for the interface and wrote the SQL queries. This project was done in
collaboration with two other students, E.T, and G.H.

This project was originally created in the prompt of learning about relational databases. This project was later refactored 
for improvements, to change the database hosting form Oracle to Heroku and PostgreSQL and to create a downloadable applet to 
use the application.
